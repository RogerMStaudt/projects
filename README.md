# ðŸš€ Web Development Learning Journey

This repository is a structured path for becoming a **full-stack web developer**.  
It covers the evolution from **basic web fundamentals** to **professional back-end frameworks** and **content management systems**.  

The idea is simple: learn step by step, project by project, and progressively build real-world skills that are directly useful for freelancing and professional work.
